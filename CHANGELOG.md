# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Community health files: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (drafted, not yet tracked).

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- **Adopted `lefthook` for committed, reproducible git hooks.** The `gitleaks` hook previously lived
  only in `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, which git does not track — it did not survive a fresh clone and did
  not exist on other machines, on a repo whose purpose includes keeping homelab details out of public
  GitHub. `lefthook.yml` is committed, so `lefthook install` reproduces the gates anywhere.
- Adds `claude plugin validate` alongside `gitleaks`, verified complementary with zero overlap: the
  validator catches manifest spec drift, while the meta-repo's consistency gate catches
  version-lockstep and `name` != directory mismatches. Neither catches the other's cases.
- Both checks **fail open** when their tool is absent — these repos are public, and a missing local
  tool must not block an external contribution. CI remains the enforcement backstop.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Portfolio-review quality pass: render the brand "Diátaxis" with its accent in all human-facing
  prose, titles, and headings across the four skills and the plugin manifest, per the house spelling
  convention. Kebab-case skill names, keywords, and URLs stay ASCII so activation matching is
  unaffected.
